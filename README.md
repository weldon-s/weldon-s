# Hello World! 👋

My name is Weldon and I'm a 4th year student in Software Engineering + Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo. I'm super passionate about programming, discrete mathematics, and linguistics, as well as all of the fascinating ways these areas intersect.

## Projects
Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the projects I'm most proud of:

__Poppy__ 🐇
- a toy programming language, soon to be a not-so-toy programming language
- developed compiler from scratch with goal of bootstrapping
- find it right here on GitHub

__Multiset__ 💸
- free (!) debt-settling app
- wrote database seeding scripts, test harnesses for SQL, and implemented optimization algorithms to minimize required transfers
- find the code on GitHub and the app at [multiset.benjaminng.ca](https://multiset.benjaminng.ca/) or on the Apple App Store

__ES-See__ 📊
- analytics and data visualization for the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC)
- implemented extensive Django backend for various metrics involving countries' performance in the contest
- find it right here on GitHub

__L2 MC__ 💬
- AP Research project from Grade 11
- identified new cross-disciplinary methodology for analyzing the effect of second-language speakers on the morphological compositionality of a language
- find the research paper at [bit.ly/l2mc](https://bit.ly/l2mc)

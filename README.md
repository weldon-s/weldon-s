# Hello World! üëã

My name is Weldon and I'm a 4th year student in Software Engineering + Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo. I'm super passionate about programming, discrete mathematics, and linguistics, as well as all of the fascinating ways these areas intersect.

## Experience
Here is a condensed list of all of my previous internships and what I worked on during each one:

__Computational Software Engineering Intern @ Augmenta__ üèóÔ∏è
- improved routing algorithms that place electrical components in buildings
- devised a novel procedural generation system using combinatorial optimization and computational geometry

__Software Engineering Intern @ Tenera Care__ üì°
- created ultra-compact representations of spatial data without compromising performance
- developed internal tools to profile APIs and new versions of localization algorithms

__Research Developer @ University of Waterloo__ üó∫Ô∏è
- contributed to design and engineering efforts behind human-computer interaction research
- built a backend for an app supporting newcomers to Canada socially and culturally

__Computer Science Intern @ Kraken Sense__ ü¶†
- wrote software for an IoT device enabling automated pathogen detection, as well as associated web dashboards
- implemented user-friendly task-scheduling systems and robust state management

## Projects
Similarly, here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the projects I'm most proud of:

__Poppy__
- a toy programming language, soon to be a not-so-toy programming language
- developed compiler from scratch with goal of bootstrapping
- find it right here on GitHub

__Multiset__
- free (!) debt-settling app
- wrote database seeding scripts, test harnesses for SQL, and implemented optimization algorithms to minimize required transfers
- find the code on GitHub and the app at [multiset.benjaminng.ca](https://multiset.benjaminng.ca/) or on the Apple App Store

__ES-See__
- analytics and data visualization for the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC)
- implemented extensive Django backend for various metrics involving countries' performance in the contest
- find it right here on GitHub

__L2 MC__
- AP Research project from Grade 11
- identified new cross-disciplinary methodology for analyzing the effect of second-language speakers on the morphological compositionality of a language
- find the research paper at [bit.ly/l2mc](https://bit.ly/l2mc)

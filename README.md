# Hello World! 👋

My name is Weldon and I'm a 4th year student in Software Engineering + Combinatorics & Optimization at the University of Waterloo. I'm super passionate about programming, discrete mathematics, and linguistics, as well as all of the fascinating ways these areas intersect. In terms of work experience, my past internships have focused on algorithm, backend, and embedded development.

## Projects
Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the projects I'm most proud of:

__Poppy__ 🐇
- a toy programming language, soon to be a not-so-toy programming language
- developed compiler from scratch with goal of bootstrapping
- find it right here on GitHub

__Multiset__ 💸
- free (!) debt-settling app
- wrote database seeding scripts, test harnesses for SQL, and implemented optimization algorithms to minimize required transfers
- find the code on GitHub and the app at [multiset.benjaminng.ca](https://multiset.benjaminng.ca/) or on the Apple App Store

__ES-See__ 📊
- analytics and data visualization for the Eurovision Song Contest (ESC)
- implemented extensive Django backend for various metrics involving countries' performance in the contest
